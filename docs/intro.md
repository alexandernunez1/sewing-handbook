# Introduction

This handbook serves as a way to document everything I learn while learning how to sew and make clothes/accessories.

## Why does this exist?

For one, I need a place to write down what tricks/techniques I pick up while learning how to sew. I figured that an e-book format would be easiest for me to access and read. Secondly, I have always wanted to make a documentation website. As I was building one from scratch that was meant to host lesson plans, I came across Docusaurus and decided to give it a try. So, this site is serving as a 'tutorial' for my lesson plan site which can be found [here](https://github.com/alexandernunez1/open-lessons).

Lastly, when I purchased my sewing machine, a Janome Skyline S6, it came with a physical instruction manual and a CD(what is this, 1990?). I don't really like flipping through the pages in the manual so I am going to take the important information from it and document it here as well. 


## Who should read this?

Anyone who is interested in sewing and learning about how clothes are made. I plan on documenting everything that I pick up while learning how to sew and working on projects.
