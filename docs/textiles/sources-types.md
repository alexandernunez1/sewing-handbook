# Sources and Types

Textiels are made from many materials, with four main sources: **animals**, **plants**, **minerals**, and **synthetic**. Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest microfibre made of strands thinner than one denier to the sturdiest canvas. Textile manufacturing terminology has a wealth of descriptive terms, from light gauze-like gossamer to heavy grosgrain cloth and beyond.

# Animals
Animal textiles are commonly made from **hair**, **fur**, **skin** or **silk**

- **Wool** refers to the hair of the domestic sheep or goat, which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped (compressed into small folds or ridges), and the wool as a whole is coated with a wax mixture known as **lanolin** (also called *wool grease*), which is waterproof and dirtproof (mainly for the sheep's protection).

> Lanolin: wax secreted by a microscopic gland in the skin that opens into a hair follicle to secreete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, which lubricates the sheep's wool and skin.

The lanolin and other contaminants are removed from the raw wool before further processing.

- **Silk** is an animal textile made from the fibres of the **cocoon** of the **Chinese silkworm** which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness. There are two main types of the silk: **'mulberry silk'** produced by the **Bombyx Mori**, and **'wild silk'** such as **Tussah silk**. Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk. Silk production consists of pillow covers, dresses, tops, skirts, bed sheets, curtains.

> Cocoon: a silky case spun by the larvae of many insects for protection in the pupal stage.


# Plants

Natural, plant-based textile fibers come from seed hair, such as cotton; from foliage, such as sisal; from the stem, such as linen; and some fibers come from shells, such as coconut.


- **Straw** and **Bamboo** are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is kapok.
- **Cotton**, **flax**, **jute**, **hemp**, **modal** and even **banana** are all used in clothing. **Pineapple fibres** are also fibres used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibres such as cotton. **Nettles** have also been used to make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of **milkweed stalk fibre** has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibres like hemp or flax.
- **Grass**, **rush**, **hemp**, and **sisal** are all used in making rope.
- The inner bark of the **Lacebark Tree** is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope.
- **Acetate** is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as **silks**, **velvets**, and **taffetats**.
- **Seaweed** is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fibre known as **alginate** is produced and is used as a holding fibre; when the cloth is finished, the alignate is dissolved, leaving an open area.
- **Rayon** is a manufactured fabric derived from plant pulp. Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.
